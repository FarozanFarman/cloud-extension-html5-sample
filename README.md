# Managed HTML5 Application Sample
SAP Cloud Platform enables you to access and run HTML5 Applications in a cloud environment without the need to maintain your own runtime infrastructure.

HTML5 Applications consist of static content that runs on a browser. Then you develop your applications - either in SAP Business Application Studio, or in your own IDE (integrated development environment) - and deploy them to the HTML5 Application Repository.

Depending on your backend application setup, you either configure the destinations during development, or define them after deploying the application. Finally, to consume the applications, you can create a site in SAP Cloud Platform Portal, build the URL, and define custom domains.
